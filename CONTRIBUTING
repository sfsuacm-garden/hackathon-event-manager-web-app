# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To keep our development process smooth and organized, please follow the branching and workflow guidelines outlined below.

## Branching Strategy

- **main**  
  The `main` branch contains stable, production-ready code. Only thoroughly tested and reviewed changes should be merged here.

- **development**  
  The `development` branch serves as the integration branch for new features. It should always be in a deployable state, though occasional breaks may occur as features are integrated and tested together.

- **Feature branches**  
  Each developer works on their own feature branch created off the `development` branch.  
  **Naming convention:** `feature/<short-description>`  
  Example: `feature/user-authentication`

- **Bugfix branches**  
  Bug fixes should be done on separate branches off `development`.  
  **Naming convention:** `bugfix/<short-description>`  
  Example: `bugfix/fix-login-error`

## Workflow

1. Create a new feature or bugfix branch following the naming conventions above.  
2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.  
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch into `development`.  
4. Request reviews from your team members.  
5. After approval and passing all tests, merge your PR into `development`.  
6. Periodically, changes from `development` will be merged into `main` once they are stable.
